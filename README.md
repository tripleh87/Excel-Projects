Hello World, 

In the excel project section, I will be uploading me excel data analysis projects, that I would like to be more less 1-1 to the Python Data Analysis projects.
What that means, is that the types of data (ex data comparisons, charts...), that have been made with pytho, I would like to do in excel.

Projects would consists of:

Sheet 1: Raw data 
Sheets 2-5 (around): Analysis of the chosen data (like in Python).
Last sheet: Dashboard.

Hope You like it.

Peace.
